# Statistics for daata science

## Project Case Scenario

### Project Scenario:
You are a Data Scientist with a housing agency in Boston, MA. You have been given access to a dataset on housing prices derived from the U.S. Census Service to present insights to higher management. Based on your expertise in statistics, your task is to provide insights that will help management make informed decisions. 

Upper management is particularly interested in the following questions:

1. **Is there a significant difference in the median value of houses bounded by the Charles River or not?**

2. **Is there a difference in median values of houses for each proportion of owner-occupied units built before 1940?**

3. **Can we conclude that there is no relationship between Nitric oxide concentrations and the proportion of non-retail business acres per town?**

4. **What is the impact of an additional weighted distance to the five Boston employment centres on the median value of owner-occupied homes?**

### Objective:
Using appropriate graphs and statistical techniques:
- Generate basic statistics and visualizations to provide useful insights to upper management.
- Include an explanation of each statistic and visualization to address the questions above.

### Note:
- notebook kernal version is Python 3.11
